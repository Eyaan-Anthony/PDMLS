Phishing website detection service using machine learning

This web application connects to a mailbox and scans individual mails to identif phishing attempts and phishing websites within each mail. It scans the email header and the email content of each mail to make this determination. The first versio of this service focuses on the functionality of it. The 'looks' aspect of it will be tangled with later.
As of now, the service basically works. It performs feature extraction and data formatting correctly. Feedback systems and some other concepts have to be implemented to render this service usable.
